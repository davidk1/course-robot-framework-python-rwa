# Testing ui / rest services by using robot framework and python
Design of real test automation framework including examples for validating web apps and services by using robot framework and python. All tests are developed to test helpful cypress's real world application: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app. To test ui three-tier-architecture by using page objects and selenium is used. Rest services utilize requests module and different, more pythonic, approach, where most of the code is python, not robot's dsl. Also the advantage of using robot's libraries in python world is presented. To demonstrate the possibility of sending individual test statuses to any log management tool and to visualise them in the dashboard, robot's listener feature is used to perform that task.
