# Testing ui / rest services by using robot framework and python
Implementation of real test automation framework including examples of validating web apps and services by using robot framework and python. All tests are developed to run against helpful cypress's real world application: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app. To test ui three-tier-architecture by using page objects and selenium is used. Rest services utilize requests module and different, more pythonic, approach, where most of the code is python, not robot's dsl. Also the advantage of using robot's libraries in python world is introduced. To demonstrate the possibility of sending individual test results to any log management tool for the purpose of visualising and analyzing them in the dashboard, robot's listener feature is presented.
